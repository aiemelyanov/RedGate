 *  p_job: passed the reserved word JOB.  when this code is executed
 *         it will have visibility to the job number via the reserved
 *         word JOB.
 *  p_status: plain text that you want associated with JOB: p_job
 *  p_desc: in case you need additional text for explaining the status
 *          field, you can pass it here.
 * Note:
 *  wwv_flow_security.g_security_group_id must be the sgid of the JOB
 *  originator
